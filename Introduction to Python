1.	Introduction to Python

C, Pascal or FORTRAN  - 	functional aspects of programming. Programming is using several function

Object oriented programming – java and .NET, programming is done by using classes and objects
		Best use when dealing with heavy projects

C = functional coding
Java  = object and classes
Python = functional programming ( C ) + objects and classes programming   ( Java )

-	Easy to understand code and develop
-	1991 by Guido Van Rossum with first working draft in 1990
-	Open source software and source code can be accessed and modify as required in the Project

Features of Python
•	Simple – feel like reading English sentence, clarity and less stress on understanding

•	Easy to learn – very few keywords and migrating from c to Python is easy

•	Open source – free and source code can be accessed and modify as required in the Project

•	High level language –
         o	Low level language – Machine language and assembly language
                                 Machine code instruction to directly interact with CPU
         o	High level language – English words to develop programs, easy to learn and use
                        COBOL, PHP OR JAVA and Python

•	Dynamically typed - *

•	Platform independent – can use almost all OS

•	Portable – portable program as it can run in any computer system by using PVM
               System dependent modules which cannot run on specific computer system

•	Procedure and object oriented
         o	C and C++ = procedure and function oriented
         o	Java  = object and classes oriented
         o	Python = procedure and function  + object and classes oriented
                    -	Ex. – Dog and Bird = Classes
                    -	Snoopy, parrot, Tommy = object
                    -	Attributes like height, weight, age, color can represented by Variable
                    -	Action like barking, biting, eating can represent by method and function
                            o	No memory allocated when class created
                            o	Memory can allocate when an object created
                            o	Objects – Variable, lists, function, arrays

•	Interpreted

•	Extensible – C and C++ by PVM (Python virtual Machine )
                JAVA code can integrated into Python by Jython and run JVM ( Java virtual machine )
                IronPython  for .NET and CLR ( Common language runtime )

•	Embeddable – python program can integrated in other language

•	Huge library

•	Scripting language – does not require complier for executing the source code

•	Database connectivity

•	Batteries included – provides small application and package for direct use
                        Ex. Scipy is scientific library to do scientific and engineering calculation
	                        Sympy is package for computer algebra system (CAS) in Python


Execution of a Python Program

1.source code – written code
2.Byte code – after using compiler
3.Machine code – after using PVM ( interpreter )
4. execution on computer


Interpreter translate program source code line by line – Slow speed

JIT compiler - Compiler + PVM   - High speed
                CPython  - software which is built in C language / JIT can not work
                PyPy – software is built in Python language / JIT can work

PVM ( python virtual machine )
